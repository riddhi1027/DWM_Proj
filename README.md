Music Recommendation System using Spotify API

This project utilizes a content-based recommendation engine to provide personalized music recommendations to users. By leveraging the Spotipy library, the engine accesses user preferences and music data from Spotify. Cosine similarity is then employed to calculate the similarity between songs, enabling the engine to suggest tracks that align with the user's taste, ultimately enhancing their music discovery experience.
